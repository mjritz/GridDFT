# GridDFT
Generates input structures in a grid-like format for gas-phase molecules and slab energy calculations

Reads in a poscar file of a gas phase precusor and a poscar file for a slab and outputs a subfolder with user specified number of sub-subfolders. 
For example, if a user specifies grid=3 in the submit file, then a subfolder will be created with 3x3 = 9 subfolders each containing input files for DFT calculations in VASP. 
This file can be easily adapted to other DFT calculators.
